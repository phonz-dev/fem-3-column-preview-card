## Overview

In this challenge, I forced myself to study and incorporate animations. I've been avoiding animations. It makes me uncomfortable especially when I see people doing cool things with it. I also just started learning JavaScript and tried adding a bit of it.

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for interactive elements

## My Process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Sass
- Mobile-first workflow
- Vanilla JavaScript

### What I learned

I learned that the major difference between CSS transition and CSS animation was that you have more control if you use animation. I also learned to use a loop to add event listeners to some elements instead of adding them one by one.

### Continued development

I would want to get more comfortable with CSS animations. Moving forward, I would find ways to incorporate animations for my future projects.
